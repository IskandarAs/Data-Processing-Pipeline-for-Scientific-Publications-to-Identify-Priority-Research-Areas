# Data-Processing-Pipeline-for-Scientific-Publications-to-Identify-Priority-Research-Areas
This repository proposes a data processing pipeline for scientific publications that allows for the systematic organization of large volumes of information and provides decision support for scientific organizations. The implementation of the pipeline utilizes the Lens.org platform, which provides access to extensive databases of scientific publications. Initially, data collection is followed by preprocessing, which includes the removal of duplicates, tokenization, lemmatization, and text vectorization. To identify hidden topics, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method of topic modeling is applied. Additionally, citation analysis and graph-based analysis of relationships between publications are conducted. Special attention is given to the development of a new metric – the "Priority Index," which combines indicators of citation, thematic relevance, and temporal trends in publications. Testing of the pipeline on a sample of over 50,000 publications from 2014–2024 demonstrated high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. The results allowed for the identification of key research areas, such as artificial intelligence, big data processing, and distributed energy systems, as well as tracking their developmental dynamics.
